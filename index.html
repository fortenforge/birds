                <h2>Coyote Hills Regional Park</h2>
                <p>On New Year's Day 2025 we visited Coyote Hills Regional Park in search of an american bittern. In
                    hindsight, with no recent sightings posted on ebird, the chances of finding one were slim to none,
                    but I was still new enough to birding to not understand this. In reality the target we should have
                    been on the lookout for was the short-eared owl, which had been seen multiple times in the preceding
                    and following days. Alas, we did not look for it and instead contended ourselves with the
                    white-tailed kites.</p>

                <h2>San Luis National Wildlife Refuge</h2>
                <p>Our first visit to an NWR of the year! After some great shots at a loggerhead
                    shrike we proceeded on the car tour still on the hunt for the american bittern. To our utter suprise
                    we found one skulking in the long reeds! It spooked when we got out of the car for a better look, so
                    we only got this one photo.</p>

                <h2>Allen's hummingbird at the San Diego Zoo</h2>
                <p>San Diego is home to a population of Allen's hummingbirds that reside there year-round rather than
                    wintering in Mexico.
                    At the zoo for a work trip I saw several males with those ridiculously attractive orange gorgets and
                    even a nesting female! </p>

                <h2>Burrowing Owls at Seal Point Park</h2>
                <p>We visited Seal Point Park in search of nothing in particular and were delighted to find two
                    burrowing owls still as statues on the rocks by the shore.
                    They're <em>tiny</em>—angry little brown tennis balls with piercing yellow eyes.

                <h2>Vermillion Flycatcher at Holy Cross Cemetery</h2>
                <p>We visited this cemetary to spot a vagrant Vermilion flycatcher. The individual in particular is an
                    immature male, so he wasn't quite as brilliantly red as most adult males, but he was starting to
                    show red on his head. The cemetery makes for an interesting location for birding; flycatchers and
                    other avian insectivores perch on the graves seeking out bugs and will fly out to grab one in
                    midair before returning to their perch. You can capture arresting photos of birds posing on
                    moss-covered tombstones.</p>
                <p> After about half an hour of walking around the specific area where it had been spotted previously
                    with no luck we considered giving up. At that point the clouds parted and it warmed up a little so
                    we decided to stay a bit longer. We soon spotted him! He flitted between gravestones and we even saw
                    him catch an insect out of the air.</p>

                <h2>Yosemite</h2>
                <p>I've always found Yosemite to be relatively bereft of wildlife. Sure, you have stunning granite
                    cliffs and rushing waterfalls, but if you're a fan of fauna the park is often disappointing. All
                    that to say, I was not expecting to stumble upon a woodpecker I had never even heard of before on
                    our trip.</p>
                <p>While hiking back from Mirror Lake we heard a loud drumming noise and soon spotted a white-headed
                    woodpecker, actively building a nest.</p>
                <p>On the drive back from the park on a random road in central California I spied what I was sure was a
                    large, populated nest. I forced us to turn around and sure enough we found a great horned owl nest
                    complete with two little owlets!</p>

                <h2>Fiji</h2>
                <p>Hawaii is a convenient travel destination for Americans looking for a sun-drenched vacation, but if
                    you've already been there a few times and want an amped-up version I highly recommend Fiji, which
                    has better snorkeling, more accessible birding (most of the birds you'll easily find on Hawaii are
                    introduced species), and fewer crowds.</p>
                <p>The bird I was most excited to see was the aptly named orange dove, endemic to the island of Taveuni.
                    It's exactly what it sounds like—picture a dove but dunk it in a bucket of vibrant, orange paint.
                    (The females are a more modest shade of green that results in much better camoflauge).

                <h2>Northern Sierra</h2>
                <p>This was a birding field trip organized by the Napa-Solano Audubon Society, and was an opportunity to
                    learn from folks whose birding skill-level is leagues above my own. One of our guides for the trip
                    is such a savant that he'll be having a full-blown conversation with you, hear a bird call, say the
                    name of the species and continue talking.
                </p>
                <p>We saw so many new warbler species (Yellow, Nashville,
                    Macgillivray's, Hermit), learned to identify the always-tricky flycatchers (Hammond's vs. Dusky vs.
                    Olive-sided), and saw a bunch of sparrows I'd never even heard of (Green-tailed towhee, Fox,
                    Brewer's and Vesper).
                </p>
                <p>Perhaps the most thrilling moment was when a young black bear reared its head at the front door of
                    our Airbnb and gave myself and my parents a huge scare. Once we collected our wits we got some great
                    footage of it ambling around our cabin.

                <h2>Ravenswood Salt Ponds</h2>
                <p>My first time seeing a black skimmer feeding! These are super cool birds that have a large lower jaw
                    that they use to catch fish by dragging their beak through the water and snapping it shut when an
                    unlucky fish swims by.
                </p>
                <p>This was a great spot to see lots of different feeding behaviors: we saw American white pelicans
                    scooping fish and draining water, elegant terns plunge feeding, and and American avocets scything
                    their bills back and forth to catch invertebrates.

                <h2>Vagrant Dark-sided Flycatcher</h2>
                <p>I'm subscribed to the South Bay Birds mailing list and while at work on September 17th I saw Eve
                    Meier post about a "Mystery Flycatcher" at Charleston Road Marsh:

                    Hi Everyone!

                    Patricia and I have a mystery flycatcher at Charleston Marsh. Here's our field marks:

                        <li>Gray overall</li>

                <p>
                    Some of my coworkers and I do a daily walk looping around the marsh (which is located just behind
                    our office), so on that day I had half a mind to keep an eye out for the bird. When we reached the
                    advertised coordinates we found three birders already present who had found the individual and were
                    attempting to get some shots of it in flight. They kindly offered us a look through their binoculars
                    and identified it as a dark-sided flycatcher—a species native to Asia and literally never before
                    recorded in the continental United States (which probably meant that I was the sixth or seventh
                    person to ever lay eyes on it within our borders)!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Vagrancy (the phenomenon of species showing up in places where they don't belong) is a common
                    occurrence in the bird world, but each individual event is rare and special. Dark-sided flycatchers
                    are migratory birds that breed in Siberia and migrate to East Asia; it's likely that this confused
                    individual followed the wrong coast south and ended up in the Bay Area as a result. Despite the
                    mistake, it seemed to be having a grand time: constantly flitting between trees, munching on berries
                    and picking insects out of the air.
                </p>
                <p>The next few days were pretty wild—when word got out that it was a rare vagrant, birders from all
                    over the country started pouring in to catch a glimpse. Google generously chose to lean-in to the
                    excitement and rather than block access to the site, they reserved parking spaces, handed out
                    refreshments and put up notices about the bird. It made me very proud to work here.
                </p>
                <p>The bird hung out in the area for a few days before disappearing on September 20th. It likely
                    continued further south and is enjoying a warm but lonely winter in Mexico right now.</p>

                <h2>American Bittern in Sunnyvale</h2>
                <p>I got word of an american bittern near the Sunnyvale Water Pollution Control Plant and decided to
                    check it out. This individual did not mind onlookers and peacefully hunted for food while we watched
                    it.
                </p>
                <p>American bitterns are goofballs. They love pointing their bill upwards and gently swaying their
                    neck to convince prey that they're just a reed, but it's a poor disguise if we're being honest.</p>

                <h2>Taiwan + Singapore</h2>
                <p>I visited Asia over Thanksgiving and got a chance to see a bunch of cool birds. My favorites are the
                    Taiwan barbet—a stunningly colorful bird endemic to Taiwan, the oriental pied hornbill—a toucan-like
                    bird that is findable even in urban Singapore, and the white-throated kingfisher (I just love all
                    kingfishers, and was so grateful to spot this one on our last day).
